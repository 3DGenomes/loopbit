# Requirements
Loopbit was written and tested using Python 3.6, 3.7.
It requires the packages `matplotlib` (3.2.1), `scipy` (1.0.0), `numpy` (1.14.5), `tensorflow` (1.10.0), and `seaborn` (0.9.0) and `tqdm` (4.32.2).

# Installation

In order to install the package you can download the code from our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/3DGenomes/loopbit) and install it manually. If needed, the dependencies will be downloaded automatically; if you encounter problems, try to install the other [requirements](#requirements) manually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3DGenomes/loopbit # or download manually
cd loopbit
python setup.py install
```

# Quick start
After the installation, you can run the provided example to familiarize with the functions of loopbit.

Use `loopbit -h` for quick help and orientation.

## Scan region of interest or full chromosome
For the tutorial we are going to use a region of the chromosome 21 from the replicate H of . We are going to analyze a 1 Mb region, from 33,379,000 to 34,379,000.

```bash
loopbit scan \
example/chr21_GM12878_replicateH.tsv \
chr21 \
45000-3000000 \
5000 \
9 \
3 \
example \
```
It will generate a output file with 2 columns, with a label and its probability of being a loop. The label will be <chromosome_binI_binJ>:

*chr21_562183_562202	1.7374185596594756e-19*

*chr21_562186_562205	1.4961456010730012e-13*

## Plot the results
In order to visualize the results we will run the following command-line:


# Usage
Loopbit has these two main commands: 
* `scan` to scan the region of interest or the full chromosome to obtain the loop prediction.
* `plot` to generate a plot of a region of interest with the contact matrix and the cloud of probabilities.
